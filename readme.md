# What the hell is this?

It's a doom mod based on [strafejumping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strafing_(video_games)#Strafe-jumping).

# I can't move!

Movement in this mod is needlessly complex because I like it that way. To build up speed:

1. Press either the strafe-left or strafe-right key.
2. Move the mouse in the same direction as the key you pressed.

The smaller the mouse movement, the greater the speed boost you'll get. The direction you're moving in only updates when you're pressing one of the strafe keys, that is, when you're pushing off with one of your legs. The boost you get drops off if you haven't pressed a movement key recently, so you'll want to build a rhythm.

You can also use recoil from your guns to get around. Sadly, you can't turn that recoil off, so bear in mind that shooting enemies will affect your movement.
